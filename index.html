            <p>I’m Daniel McGlinchey, I’ am currently an Exchange student from England.
                I was born in the city of Leeds in the county of Yorkshire,
                this is in the north of England.
                Back in England, I study at Northumbria University,
                located in Newcastle. Where I study Information Technology and Management for business.
                I started at Northumbria in September of 2015 and I plan to go back there in September to finish my degree.
                During my studies at Northumbria I have developed knowledge and skills in the following key areas:
                Database design, Spreadsheets, Web Development, Big Data and Java.
                I plan to keep developing upon these skills and add more skills to my list.</p>

            <p>For this Academic year, I spent the first half working in industry for my chosen field of study and the second half
                is studying aboard, here in New Jersey. In my first semester,
                I spent it doing a work placement at the company SPI
                (Styrene Packaging & Insulation Ltd), which is the UK
                largest producer of styrene. For this job, I worked in the
                office providing IT support and working on the website.
                Some of the duties that were included for IT support;
                setting email accounts for staff, their computer and
                wiring devices to the network. This was a nine to
                four job require me to work thirty-five hours a week.</p>

            <p>Currently, I’m studying at The College of New Jersey for a semester,
                I arrived here on the 23rd of January and will leave in May. The subjects that I have chosen are like what
                I’m doing back at home, having subjects that include IT and business.</p>
