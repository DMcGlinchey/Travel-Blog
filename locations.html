            <p class="ttext">Leeds is the city where I was Born/ come from. It is the UK's third largest city after
                London and birmingham. The city is part of Yorkshire in the north of England. The city was formed in 1207
                built by the River Aire. The city was  small up untill the industrial revolution where the city was made more
                important and started to rapidly grow. Building a canel that would transport good west to Liverpool and
                the uses of the river to transport goods east to hull. Outside of London it is the second for finance, having a lot of
                business move there after the second world war.</p>

            <p class="ttext">Yorkshire is a historic county in northern England. It’s known for its Roman and Viking
                heritage, as well as its Norman castles, medieval abbeys, Industrial Revolution-era cities and 2
                national parks. The county was found over 1000 years ago. Represented by the white rose that comes
                from the war of the roses in the 15th century. A war that was against Lancashire who are represented
                by the red rose a rivalry that still exist today. Yorkshire is home to cities such as Leeds, Sheffield,
                Hull and York the city New York is Name after. York is one of the most historical cities in the UK
                being nearly 2000 years old and once being the capital of the country.

            <p class="ttext"> Leeds United is the Football club (soccer) I support. The club was formed in 1919 following the
                disbanding of two teams in the city. Sadly, the teams have been through some hard times, once being
                considered the best English football team and could even rival most international teams. The team currently play at the
                Elland Road Stadium with the manager of Marcelo Biles. The team colours are white, blue and yellow
                based on the Yorkshire flags colours, even including the Yorkshire rose on the team’s logo.

            <p class="ttext">Back in England, I study at Northumbria University. The University is in Newcastle
                upon Tyne in the North East of England. I have been studying here since September 2015, studying the subject
                Information Technology and Management for business. During my studies, I have developed knowledge and
                skills in the following key areas: Database design, Spreadsheets, Web Development, Big Data and Java. Compared to TCNJ
                my university looks very different, being in a city centre, the builder is a lot closer together and
                even some department is at another campus 20 minutes away.
