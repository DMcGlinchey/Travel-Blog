        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, I'm Daniel McGlinchey, I am currently studying Information Technology management at Northumbria
            University. I have created the website to show my 2015 holiday to the USA. Explaining some of my experience
            in the holiday, saying what I've enjoyed and what I didn't. The USA was already a country I had a great
            interest in and visited before to Florida. Being a country I've always wanted to further explore. Getting
            the chance to see places that I've seen in movies and TVs.</p>

        <p>
            I arrived in Las Vegas on Friday the 10th of July and left there on Monday after. Leaving the airport, I
            have never felt the heat like that. Several steps felt like a mile; you can understand why people never left
            their hotel in Vegas. The time when we arrived was five o clock in the afternoon which in the UK was about
            12. Forcing myself to stay up, so I'll be on the US time.
        </p>

        <p>This is a trip I took in 2015 to the United States of America. Having me go to three different states which
            include the state of Nevada, California and New York. The trip lasted for three weeks, starting 10th of July
            and ending on the 1st of August. On the 10th of July, we flew out of Manchester Airport and arrived in Las
            Vegas later that day, taking 10.5 hours. We spent the weekend in Vegas until Monday where we left the city
            of sin and head through Death Valley to California.</p>
        <p>The first place we visited in California was San Diego, this took us about fours to arrive from Las Vegas.
            Driving through the Mojave Desert, considered the hottest place on the earth, you can understand why even
            just looking outside at that heat made me warm. Seeing a field of solar panel looking like a blurred
            lake.</p>
        <p>We stay in San Diego for three days until the 15th where we headed up to Los Angeles. Los angle is where we
            stay for a signified amount of the trip, stay there for ten days and leaving on the 25th. We had plans to go
            Yosemite national park, but when arrived we were told there was a forest fire and everyone had to evacuate.
            Leaving Yosemite we could see several helicopters flying down to pick up water for the forest, itâ€™s a shame
            I was hoping to see a bear. Because of this incident, we arrived in San Francisco early and spent the 25th
            to the 30th there.</p>
        <p>For the final part of the trip, we flew out from San Francisco and landed in New York where we spent the last
            three days. When the 1st of August arrived we flew back to the UK and arrived back in the early hours of the
            2nd of August.</p>
