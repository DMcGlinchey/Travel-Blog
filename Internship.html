            <p>For my first semester in this academic year, I spent it doing a work placement at the company SPI
                (Styrene Packaging & Insulation Ltd), which is the UK largest producer of styrene. For this job,
                I worked in the office providing IT support and working on the website. Some of the duties that
                were included for IT support; setting up email accounts for staff,
                setting their computers and wiring devices to the network.
                This was a nine to four job require me to work thirty-five hours a week.</p>
