            Currently, I’m studying at The College of New Jersey for a semester,
            I arrived here on the 23rd of January and will leave in May. Studying abroad was something I’ve always wanted
            to do and has been an amazing opportunity. I've known I was coming here since March 2018 when I got my acceptance
            letter. I choose TCNJ for its area, giving me the chance to visit locations like New York City and Philadelphia.
            I also choose TNCJ because it stood out to me more than the other university options I had.
            The subjects that I have chosen are similar to what I’m doing back at home, having subjects that include IT and business.
        </p>

            <ul><li>Chosen Subjects</li>
                <li>Cs I for Science/Engnrg</li>
                <li>Web Design and Development</li>
                <li>Management Principles & Practice</li>
                <li>Organizational Behavior</li>

                <img src="image/tcnj2.jpg" alt="valid"/>
            </figure>
            <p>Being here has allowed me to experience what it like to study in the US and in another country. TCNJ and
                my university from home have a lot of similarities, but there is a lot of things that are different. How they
                differ is at home I choose one course similar to a major here. At first when picking my subjects and even starting
                here I thought it was strange choosing multiple subjects that can be completely different from one another.
                It was strange at the start that TCNJ isn't in a city, being so used to being in a city at my home and university,
                it felt like a big change.
